# What is Hive Gateway?

Open-source GraphQL federation gateway

::left::

## The Problem

- Multiple GraphQL services scattered across teams
- Each has its own API endpoint and schema
- Clients need to know about all services
- No unified security or monitoring

## The Solution

A unified GraphQL layer that:

- Combines multiple schemas into one
- Routes queries to appropriate services
- Handles federation complexity automatically
- Provides single endpoint for clients

::right::

## How It Works

### Federation Router

- Composes supergraph from subgraph schemas
- Plans query execution across services
- Merges responses transparently

### Proxy Gateway

- Can proxy any existing GraphQL API
- No schema changes required
- Add security and monitoring instantly

### Subgraph Support

- Can act as a federated subgraph itself
- Integrates with existing federation

<!--
- For those of you who might not be familiar with Hive Gateway yet, let me explain what it is first
- Think of it as solving the "microservices for GraphQL" problem
- Instead of clients calling multiple GraphQL APIs, they call one gateway
- The gateway handles all the complexity of routing, federation, and composition
- It can work as a federation router, a simple proxy, or even as a subgraph itself
- This eliminates the client-side complexity of managing multiple endpoints
-->

# Our Demo App

Simple Blog Platform

::left::

### Users Service

- User profiles with ID, name, email

### Posts Service

- Blog posts with title and content
- Author relationship via federation
- Role-based access control
- Real-time post notifications

::right::

## Perfect for demonstrating

- GraphQL Yoga for subgraphs
- Hive Gateway for federation
- JWT authentication + authorization directives
- HMAC signature security
- Real-time subscriptions

## User Roles

- üë§ Authenticated user: can see user emails
- üëë Admin: Can delete any post
- ‚úçÔ∏è Editor: Can create and delete posts

<!--
- For our demo today, we needed to choose a domain that would showcase all these features effectively:
- A simple blog platform that everyone understands
- We'll have two services: one for users with profiles and authentication, and one for posts with real-time features
- The users service will demonstrate field-level security by placing email addresses behind authentication,
- while the posts service will show off role-based authorization and real-time notifications.
- This domain perfectly demonstrates federation, security, and scalability features
-->

# Federation Architecture

How Our Services Connect

```mermaid

    Gateway <--> Users[Users Subgraph]
    Gateway <--> Posts[Posts Subgraph]

    Gateway -->|OpenTelemetry Trace Exporter| Jaeger[Jaeger Tracing]

    Posts -.->|Publishes| NATS

    style Gateway fill:orange,color:black
    style Users fill:blue
    style Posts fill:blue
```

<!--
- Let me give you a visual overview of the complete architecture we're building
- The gateway sits in front of our two GraphQL Yoga subgraphs
- We'll use GraphQL Mesh to compose our supergraph from the individual schemas
- Federation connects users to posts across service boundaries
- NATS will handle our distributed subscriptions for real-time features
- And Jaeger will collect traces from everything for complete observability
- This diagram shows how all the pieces fit together in our production setup

# Multi-Layer Security

JWT + Field-Level Authorization + HMAC

::left::

### Authentication Layer

- JWT token validation
- Support for RS256/HS256 algorithms
- User identity and scopes/scopes extraction

### Authorization Layer

- `@authenticated` directive for basic protection
- `@requiresScopes` directive for role-based access
- Field-level permission control

::right::

## Security Layers

JWT Authentication

- Validates user identity
- Carries user roles/scopes

Authorization Directives

- `@authenticated` - requires any valid user
- `@requiresScopes` - requires specific roles

HMAC Signatures

- Secure subgraph communication
- Protection against tampering

<!--
- Now that we've seen the overall architecture, let's dive into security.
- We'll have three layers of security working together here:
- JWT handles authentication, identity and carries role information from the client
- Subgraph directives enforce permissions at the field level
- And HMAC signatures secure the internal communication and ensure only the gateway can communicate with the subgraphs
-->

# Security Flow

Multi-Layer Security

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Gateway as Hive Gateway
    participant Auth as JWT Validator
    participant Users as Users Service
    participant Posts as Posts Service

    Client->>Gateway: Query with JWT
    Gateway->>Auth: Validate JWT
    Auth-->>Gateway: User + Scopes
    Gateway->>Users: Query user.email (@authenticated)
    Gateway->>Posts: Query posts (@requiresScopes: editor)
    Users-->>Gateway: Email (if authenticated)
    Posts-->>Gateway: Posts (if has editor scope)
    Gateway-->>Client: Combined Response
```

<!--
- This is how the security flow works in our implementation
- JWT validation happens at the gateway level first
- The directives enforce field-level authorization rules
- We'll show two approaches: forwarding JWT payload directly to subgraphs, and extracting user ID to propagate as headers
- Each service enforces its own authorization rules but the gateway handles the restrictions
- Important note: if the JWT doesn't have the necessary permissions defined by the directives, the request won't even reach the users or posts services - the gateway blocks it early
- We'll demonstrate this with both authenticated fields and scope-based mutations
-->

---

# Production-Grade Protection

Security Features

### Rate Limiting üö¶

- Global gateway rate limits
- Per-field rate limiting with `@rateLimit` directive
- Prevent abuse and DoS attacks

### Query Protection üõ°Ô∏è

- Maximum query depth limits
- Character count restrictions
- _And much more..._

<!--
- But there's more security beyond authentication and authorization!
- Beyond authentication and authorization, we need to protect against abuse
- Rate limiting prevents abuse at multiple levels of your system
- The `@rateLimit` directive lets you protect specific heavy fields - for example, you could rate limit an expensive search operation while allowing normal queries to flow freely
- Query protection stops malicious deep nested queries that could overwhelm your servers
- For example, someone could write a query that goes 50 levels deep and crashes your API
- We have many more query protection features available like complexity analysis and alias limits, but we'll showcase these two to get you started with secure defaults
- These features are essential if you're exposing APIs publicly

# Traditional GraphQL Subscriptions

How real-time updates work

::left::

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Gateway
    participant Service
    participant DataSource

    Client->>Gateway: subscription { postAdded }
    Gateway->>Service: Subscribe to post events
    Service->>Gateway: Subscription established
    Gateway->>Client: WebSocket connection

    Note over DataSource: New post created
    DataSource->>Service: Post created event
    Service->>Gateway: postAdded data
    Gateway->>Client: Real-time update
```

::right::

## Scaling Challenges

### WebSocket Limitations

- **Stateful connections** - Each client holds open connection consuming server memory
- **Sticky sessions** - Clients must reconnect to same server instance
- **Vertical scaling only** - Can't distribute connections across instances
- **Connection storms** - Mass reconnections during server restarts

### Server-Sent Events (SSE) Issues

- **Same memory problems** - Each connection consumes server resources
- **HTTP/1.1 connection limits** - Browsers limit concurrent connections per domain
- **No bidirectional communication** - Server can only push, not receive
- **Connection management complexity** - Handling disconnects and reconnects

### Resource Consumption

- **Memory per connection** - 2-8KB per WebSocket, multiplied by thousands of users
- **Event loop blocking** - Too many connections can overwhelm Node.js event loop
- **Network overhead** - Keeping connections alive requires constant heartbeats

<!--
- Let's talk subscriptions now
- I mentioned EDFS, but first let us take a step back and explain GraphQL subscriptions for those who might be new to them
- In traditional GraphQL subscriptions, a client opens a subscription typically over a WebSocket connection
- The server maintains the connection and pushes updates when data changes
- This works great for single instances but has serious scaling challenges
- WebSockets are stateful - each connection consumes server memory and creates sticky sessions
- With thousands of users, you're looking at megabytes of memory just for connection overhead
- Server-Sent Events have similar problems plus HTTP connection limits
- You can't easily distribute these connections across multiple server instances
- In federated structures, gateways connect to subgraphs for subscriptions, putting pressure on both gateways and subgraphs
- This creates bottlenecks because subgraphs become single points of failure for subscription data
- You can't easily have multiple distributed gateways because each needs its own connection to subgraphs
- When your server restarts, all clients have to reconnect at once creating connection storms
-->

# EDFS - Subscriptions That Scale

Event-Driven Federated Subscriptions

::left::

### Traditional Subscriptions

- Tied to single gateway instance
- Limited scalability
- Single point of failure

### EDFS with v2

- Distributed across multiple gateways
- Horizontal scaling with NATS
- Fault tolerance built-in
- Built-in adapters included

::right::

## What we'll build

- Real-time post notifications
- NATS message broker integration
- Multi-instance subscription handling
- Fault-tolerant messaging

### Perfect for

Real-time features at enterprise scale üåê

<!--
- EDFS to the rescue!
- Why are Event-Driven Federated Subscriptions such a game changer for real-time features?
- Well, traditional subscriptions simply don't scale well beyond a single instance
- EDFS solves this by using message brokers like NATS, Kafka, or Redis
- Starting v2, Hive Gateway's pubsub has built-in adapters making setup with any of these message brokers easy
- Perfect for real-time features that need to scale to thousands of users!
- Here's a cool feature: with EDFS, you can emit only the keys of a type and the gateway will resolve the rest of the fields
- For example, our Post type has an "id" key - you can publish a message to NATS "postAdded" subject containing only the "id" field, but request more fields in the subscription query
- The gateway will intelligently resolve any other fields provided in the GraphQL subscription query, fetching data from the appropriate subgraphs as needed
-->

---

# EDFS Architecture

Event-Driven Federated Subscriptions

```mermaid
graph LR
    Client1[Client 1] --> Gateway1[Gateway Instance 1]
    Client2[Client 2] --> Gateway2[Gateway Instance 2]
    Client3[Client 3] --> Gateway3[Gateway Instance 3]

    Gateway1 --> NATS[NATS Message Broker]
    Gateway2 --> NATS
    Gateway3 --> NATS

    PostService[Post Creation Service] --> NATS

    NATS -.->|Real-time Updates| Gateway1
    NATS -.->|Real-time Updates| Gateway2
    NATS -.->|Real-time Updates| Gateway3

    style Gateway1 fill:orange,color:black
    style Gateway2 fill:orange,color:black
    style Gateway3 fill:orange,color:black
    style NATS fill:green
    style PostService fill:cyan,color:black
```

<!--
- EDFS in practice looks something like this
- Here you can see multiple gateway instances all connected via NATS
- where any service can publish events to the message broker
- All connected clients get real-time updates regardless of which gateway they're connected to
- This scales horizontally unlike traditional WebSocket or SSE subscriptions
- The beauty of EDFS is that it decouples the subscription source from the subscription consumers
- Services can publish events to NATS without knowing which gateways or clients are listening
- Gateways can scale independently because they're not holding stateful connections to subgraphs
- If one gateway goes down, clients can reconnect to another gateway and still receive all the same real-time updates
- The message broker handles the distribution, making the whole system fault-tolerant and highly available

# OpenTelemetry Made Simple

Production-Grade Observability

::left::

### What we'll configure

- Gateway tracing with Jaeger integration
- Erm, that's it... Everything else Just Works ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è

::right::

## What you get

- Perfect traces with proper span hierarchy
- Contextual data in every span
- GraphQL context, HTTP details, upstream execution info

<!--
- One thing I love about v2 is how simple observability has become
- The OpenTelemetry setup is incredibly easy now,
- only a few lines of configuration gets you complete distributed tracing.
- Basically, you just have to configure OpenTelemetry itself,
- Hive Gateway will pick up the rest.
- Spans are automatically created for all GraphQL operations allowing you
- to see the entire request flow through your federation!
-->

# Hive Logger

Modern logging for GraphQL applications

### Key Features

- üè∑Ô∏è **Structured Logging** - JSON output with consistent metadata
- üîó **Request Correlation** - Automatic request ID propagation
- üìä **Context Inheritance** - Child loggers inherit parent metadata
- üîÑ **Dynamic Log Levels** - Change verbosity without restarts
- üîå **Pluggable Writers** - Pino, Winston, or custom integrations

### Perfect for Production

- Filter logs by request ID to trace entire request lifecycle
- Structured data makes log aggregation and searching easier
- Performance optimized with lazy evaluation
- Cross-platform compatibility (Node.js, Bun, edge runtimes)

<!--
- Before we talk about dynamic logging, let me introduce Hive Logger
- It's our modern logging solution designed specifically for GraphQL applications
- The key innovation is request correlation - every log entry automatically gets tagged with the request ID
- This means you can filter your logs by a specific request and see its entire journey
- Child loggers inherit metadata from parents, so context flows naturally through your application
- It's built for performance with lazy evaluation of log messages
- And you can plug in your favorite logging library like Pino or Winston as the underlying writer
-->

---

# Dynamic Logging Revolution

Change Log Levels Without Restarts üîÑ

- Structured logging with request-level metadata
- Request IDs flowing through entire request lifecycle
- Dynamic log level switching during live operation
- Production debugging without downtime

<!--
- Now let's see Hive Logger in action with its most impressive feature
- Request IDs make debugging so much easier in distributed systems
- And here's the real game changer: you can switch to debug mode without restarting your production gateway!
- This is absolutely essential for troubleshooting production issues
- Imagine it's 3am, something's wrong in production, and you need more verbose logging
- Instead of restarting services and potentially making things worse, you just change the log level
- I'll demo changing log levels live during our session
