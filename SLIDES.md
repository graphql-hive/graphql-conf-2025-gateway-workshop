# Our Demo App

Simple Blog Platform

::left::

### Users Service

- User profiles with ID, name, email

### Posts Service

- Blog posts with title and content
- Author relationship via federation
- Role-based access control
- Real-time post notifications

::right::

## Perfect for demonstrating

- GraphQL Yoga for subgraphs
- Hive Gateway for federation
- JWT authentication + authorization directives
- HMAC signature security
- Real-time subscriptions

## User Roles

- üë§ Authenticated user: can see user emails
- üëë Admin: Can delete any post
- ‚úçÔ∏è Editor: Can create and delete posts

<!--
- For our demo today, we needed to choose a domain that would showcase all these features effectively
- We chose a simple blog platform that everyone understands
- We'll have two services: one for users with profiles and authentication, and one for posts with real-time features
- The users service will demonstrate field-level security with email addresses behind authentication
- The posts service will show off role-based authorization and real-time notifications
- This domain perfectly demonstrates federation, security, and scalability features
-->

# Workshop Flow

What We'll Build Together

### Foundation

1. Create Users & Posts subgraphs (GraphQL Yoga)
2. Bootstrap Hive Gateway v2

### Production Features

3. JWT authentication + field-level authorization
4. HMAC signatures for subgraph security
5. Event-Driven Federated Subscriptions
6. Dynamic structured logging (change levels without restarts!)

### Production Polish

7. Security hardening (rate limits, depth limits)
8. Response caching & deduplication
9. OpenTelemetry tracing ‚Üí Jaeger

<!--
- Alright, let me walk you through exactly how we're going to structure our time together
- The flow will look like this:

# Federation Architecture

How Our Services Connect

```mermaid
graph TB
    Client[Client App] --> Gateway[Hive Gateway]
    Gateway <--> Users[Users Subgraph]
    Gateway <--> Posts[Posts Subgraph]

    Gateway -->|OpenTelemetry Trace Exporter| Jaeger[Jaeger Tracing]

    Gateway -->|Subscribes| NATS[NATS Message Broker]
    NATS -.->|Real-time Updates| Gateway
    Posts -.->|Publishes| NATS

    style Gateway fill:orange,color:black
    style Users fill:blue
    style Posts fill:blue
```

<!--
- Now let me give you a visual overview of the complete architecture we're building
- The gateway sits in front of our two GraphQL Yoga subgraphs
- We'll have federation connecting users to posts across service boundaries
- NATS will handle our distributed subscriptions for real-time features
- And Jaeger will collect traces from everything for complete observability
- This diagram shows how all the pieces fit together in production
-->

# Multi-Layer Security

JWT + Field-Level Authorization + HMAC

::left::

### Authentication Layer

- JWT token validation
- Support for RS256/HS256 algorithms
- User identity and scopes/scopes extraction

### Authorization Layer

- `@authenticated` directive for basic protection
- `@requiresScopes` directive for role-based access
- Field-level permission control

::right::

## Security Layers

JWT Authentication

- Validates user identity
- Carries user roles/scopes

Authorization Directives

- `@authenticated` - requires any valid user
- `@requiresScopes` - requires specific roles

HMAC Signatures

- Secure subgraph communication
- Protection against tampering

<!--
- Now that we've seen the overall architecture, let's dive into our security implementation
- We'll have three layers of security working together here:
- JWT handles identity and carries role information from the client
- Subgraph directives enforce permissions at the field level
- And HMAC signatures secure the internal communication and ensure only the gateway can communicate with the subgraphs
-->

# Security Flow

Multi-Layer Security

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Gateway as Hive Gateway
    participant Auth as JWT Validator
    participant Users as Users Service
    participant Posts as Posts Service

    Client->>Gateway: Query with JWT
    Gateway->>Auth: Validate JWT
    Auth-->>Gateway: User + Scopes
    Gateway->>Users: Query user.email (@authenticated)
    Gateway->>Posts: Query posts (@requiresScopes: editor)
    Users-->>Gateway: Email (if authenticated)
    Posts-->>Gateway: Posts (if has editor scope)
    Gateway-->>Client: Combined Response
```

<!--
- This is how the security flow looks like
- It is quite straightforward:
- JWT validation happens at the gateway level first.
- The directives enforce field-level authorization rules
- The gateway passes user context down to subgraphs
- Each service enforces its own authorization rules but the gateway handles the restrictions
-->

---

# Production-Grade Protection

Security Features

### Rate Limiting üö¶

- Global gateway rate limits
- Per-field rate limiting with `@rateLimit` directive
- Prevent abuse and DoS attacks

### Query Protection üõ°Ô∏è

- Maximum query depth limits
- Query complexity analysis
- Character count restrictions

<!--
- But there's more!
- Beyond authentication and authorization, we need to protect against abuse
- Which features help with that?
- Rate limiting prevents abuse at multiple levels of your system
- Query protection stops malicious deep nested queries that could overwhelm your servers,
- for example, someone could write a query that goes 50 levels deep and crashes your API.
- These features are essential if you're exposing APIs publicly

# Traditional GraphQL Subscriptions

How real-time updates work

::left::

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Gateway
    participant Service
    participant DataSource

    Client->>Gateway: subscription { postAdded }
    Gateway->>Service: Subscribe to post events
    Service->>Gateway: Subscription established
    Gateway->>Client: WebSocket connection

    Note over DataSource: New post created
    DataSource->>Service: Post created event
    Service->>Gateway: postAdded data
    Gateway->>Client: Real-time update
```

::right::

## Limitations

- Tied to single server instance
- WebSocket connections don't scale horizontally
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) have same scaling issues
- Memory intensive for many concurrent subscriptions

<!--
- Before we dive into EDFS, let's take a step back and explain GraphQL subscriptions for those who might be new to them
- In traditional GraphQL subscriptions, a client opens a subscription typically over WebSocket
- The server maintains the connection and pushes updates when data changes
- This works great for single instances but has serious scaling challenges
- WebSockets are stateful - each connection consumes server memory and creates sticky sessions
- With thousands of users, you're looking at megabytes of memory just for connection overhead
- Server-Sent Events have similar problems plus HTTP connection limits
- You can't easily distribute these connections across multiple server instances
- When your server restarts, all clients have to reconnect at once creating connection storms
-->

# EDFS - Subscriptions That Scale

Event-Driven Federated Subscriptions

::left::

### Traditional Subscriptions

- Tied to single gateway instance
- Limited scalability
- Single point of failure

### EDFS with v2

- Distributed across multiple gateways
- Horizontal scaling with NATS
- Fault tolerance built-in
- Built-in adapters included

::right::

## What we'll build

- Real-time post notifications
- NATS message broker integration
- Multi-instance subscription handling
- Fault-tolerant messaging

### Perfect for

Real-time features at enterprise scale üåê

<!--
- EDFS to the rescue!
- Let me explain why Event-Driven Federated Subscriptions is such a game changer for real-time features
- Traditional subscriptions simply don't scale well beyond a single instance,
- EDFS solves this by using message brokers like NATS or Redis.
- Hive Gateway's pubsub has built-in adapters making setup with either of the message brokers easy
- Perfect for real-time features that need to scale to thousands of users!
-->

---

# EDFS Architecture

Event-Driven Federated Subscriptions

```mermaid
graph LR
    Client1[Client 1] --> Gateway1[Gateway Instance 1]
    Client2[Client 2] --> Gateway2[Gateway Instance 2]
    Client3[Client 3] --> Gateway3[Gateway Instance 3]

    Gateway1 --> NATS[NATS Message Broker]
    Gateway2 --> NATS
    Gateway3 --> NATS

    PostService[Post Creation Service] --> NATS

    NATS -.->|Real-time Updates| Gateway1
    NATS -.->|Real-time Updates| Gateway2
    NATS -.->|Real-time Updates| Gateway3

    style Gateway1 fill:orange,color:black
    style Gateway2 fill:orange,color:black
    style Gateway3 fill:orange,color:black
    style NATS fill:green
    style PostService fill:cyan,color:black
```

<!--
- EDFS in practice looks something like this
- Here you can see multiple gateway instances all connected via NATS,
- where any service can publish events to the message broker.
- All connected clients get real-time updates regardless of which gateway they're connected to
- This scales horizontally unlike traditional WebSocket or SSE subscriptions
-->

# OpenTelemetry Made Simple

Production-Grade Observability

::left::

### What we'll configure

- Gateway tracing with Jaeger integration
- Erm, that's it... Everything else Just Works ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è

::right::

## What you get

- Perfect traces with proper span hierarchy
- Contextual data in every span
- GraphQL context, HTTP details, upstream execution info

<!--
- One thing I love about v2 is how simple observability has become
- The OpenTelemetry setup is incredibly easy now,
- only a few lines of configuration gets you complete distributed tracing.
- Spans are automatically created for all GraphQL operations allowing you
- to see the entire request flow through your federation!
-->

---

# Dynamic Logging Revolution

Change Log Levels Without Restarts üîÑ

- Structured logging with request-level metadata
- Request IDs flowing through entire request lifecycle
- Dynamic log level switching during live operation
- Production debugging without downtime

<!--
- Here's another feature that makes production operations so much easier!
- Request IDs make debugging so much easier in distributed systems
- And now, logging got even better, you can switch to debug mode without restarting your production gateway!
- This is absolutely essential for troubleshooting production issues
- I'll demo changing log levels live during our session
-->
