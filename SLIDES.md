# What's New in v2

Production-Grade GraphQL Federation

### Key v2 Features

- üîç Enhanced OpenTelemetry - Perfect traces with proper setup
- üìä Dynamic Structured Logging - Change levels without restarts
- üöÄ Event-Driven Subscriptions - Horizontally scalable with NATS
- ‚ö° Request Deduplication - Automatic performance optimization
- üíæ Response Caching - Make less requests
- üõ°Ô∏è Advanced Security - JWT, HMAC, field-level authorization

_Built for production workloads from day one_

<!--
- These features solve real production problems, it's not just a feature showcase
- Enhanced OpenTelemetry means one config change gets you complete distributed tracing
- Dynamic logging without restarts is huge when you're debugging issues at 3am
- Event-driven subscriptions are new in Hive Gateway and let subscriptions scale horizontally
- Request deduplication automatically prevents duplicate network calls to subgraphs (elaborate?)
- Response caching reduces load on your backend services
- Advanced security gives you enterprise-grade protection out of the box
- All of this was built based on feedback from teams running v1 in production
- We'll see every single one of these features in action today

# Our Demo App

Simple Blog Platform

::left::

### Users Service

- User profiles with ID, name, email

### Posts Service

- Blog posts with title and content
- Author relationship via federation
- Role-based access control
- Real-time post notifications

::right::

## Perfect for demonstrating

- GraphQL Yoga for subgraphs
- Hive Gateway for federation
- JWT authentication + authorization directives
- HMAC signature security
- Real-time subscriptions

## User Roles

- üë§ Authenticated user: can see user emails
- üëë Admin: Can delete any post
- ‚úçÔ∏è Editor: Can create and delete posts

<!--
- We chose a simple domain that everyone understands
- We'll have two services that we'll federate together
- This is perfect for showing auth patterns with intuitive user roles or scopes
- The real-time notifications will showcase our new EDFS feature

# Workshop Flow

What We'll Build Together

### Part 1: Foundation (20 min)

- Create Users & Posts subgraphs (GraphQL Yoga)
- Bootstrap Hive Gateway v2

### Part 2: Production Features (45 min)

- JWT authentication + field-level authorization
- HMAC signatures for subgraph security
- Event-Driven Federated Subscriptions
- Dynamic structured logging (change levels without restarts!)

### Part 3: Production Polish (15 min)

- Security hardening (rate limits, depth limits)
- Response caching & deduplication
- OpenTelemetry tracing ‚Üí Jaeger

<!--
- The flow will look like this
- First we get the foundation working with basic federation
- Then we add the production features which are the meat of this workshop
- Finally we polish it with enterprise-grade features
- The timeline is ambitious but totally achievable

# Federation Architecture

How Our Services Connect

```mermaid
graph TB
    Client[Client App] --> Gateway[Hive Gateway v2]
    Gateway --> Users[Users Service<br/>GraphQL Yoga]
    Gateway --> Posts[Posts Service<br/>GraphQL Yoga]

    Users -.->|Federation Key| Posts
    Gateway --> NATS[NATS Broker]
    Gateway --> Jaeger[Jaeger Tracing]

    style Gateway fill:orange,color:black
    style Users fill:blue
    style Posts fill:blue
```

<!--
- Lets quickly see how the architecture looks
- The gateway sits in front of our two GraphQL Yoga services
- Federation connect users to posts across service boundaries
- NATS handles our distributed subscriptions
- And Jaeger collects traces about everything from the gateway for observability

# Security Flow

Multi-Layer Protection

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Gateway as Hive Gateway
    participant Auth as JWT Validator
    participant Users as Users Service
    participant Posts as Posts Service

    Client->>Gateway: Query with JWT
    Gateway->>Auth: Validate JWT
    Auth-->>Gateway: User + Scopes
    Gateway->>Users: Query user.email (@authenticated)
    Gateway->>Posts: Query posts (@requiresScopes: editor)
    Users-->>Gateway: Email (if authenticated)
    Posts-->>Gateway: Posts (if has editor scope)
    Gateway-->>Client: Combined Response
```

<!--
- The security flow is quite straight forward
- JWT validation happens at the gateway level first
- Our directives enforce field-level authorization rules
- The gateway passes user context down to subgraphs
- Each service enforces its own authorization rules but the gateway handles the restrictions
-->

# Multi-Layer Security

JWT + Field-Level Authorization + HMAC

::left::

### Authentication Layer

- JWT token validation
- Support for RS256/HS256 algorithms
- User identity and scopes/scopes extraction

### Authorization Layer

- `@authenticated` directive for basic protection
- `@requiresScopes` directive for role-based access
- Field-level permission control

::right::

## Security Layers

JWT Authentication

- Validates user identity
- Carries user roles/scopes

Authorization Directives

- `@authenticated` - requires any valid user
- `@requiresScopes` - requires specific roles

HMAC Signatures

- Secure subgraph communication
- Protection against tampering

<!--
Introspection
- Available to everyone for development
-->

<!--
- We'll have three layers of security working together here
- JWT handles identity and carries role information
- Our directives enforce permissions at the field level
- HMAC signatures secure the internal communication and make sure only the gateway can communicate with the subgraps
-->

# Security Features

Production-Grade Protection

### Rate Limiting üö¶

- Global gateway rate limits
- Per-field rate limiting with `@rateLimit` directive
- Prevent abuse and DoS attacks

### Query Protection üõ°Ô∏è

- Maximum query depth limits
- Query complexity analysis
- Character count restrictions

<!--
- Ok, what about the security features
- Rate limiting prevents abuse at multiple levels of your system
- Query protection stops malicious deep nested queries (_TODO: elaborate_)
- These features are essential if you're exposing APIs publicly

# EDFS Architecture

Event-Driven Federated Subscriptions

```mermaid
graph LR
    Client1[Client 1] --> Gateway1[Gateway Instance 1]
    Client2[Client 2] --> Gateway2[Gateway Instance 2]
    Client3[Client 3] --> Gateway3[Gateway Instance 3]

    Gateway1 --> NATS[NATS Message Broker]
    Gateway2 --> NATS
    Gateway3 --> NATS

    PostService[Post Creation Service] --> NATS

    NATS -.->|Real-time Updates| Gateway1
    NATS -.->|Real-time Updates| Gateway2
    NATS -.->|Real-time Updates| Gateway3

    style Gateway1 fill:orange,color:black
    style Gateway2 fill:orange,color:black
    style Gateway3 fill:orange,color:black
    style NATS fill:green
    style PostService fill:cyan,color:black
```

<!--
- Now the interesting part, EDFS which stands for event driven federated subscriptions
- Here you can see multiple gateway instances all connected via NATS
- Any service can publish events to the message broker
- All connected clients get real-time updates regardless of which gateway they're connected to
- This scales horizontally unlike traditional WebSocket or SSE subscriptions
-->

# EDFS - Subscriptions That Scale

Event-Driven Federated Subscriptions

::left::

### Traditional Subscriptions

- Tied to single gateway instance
- Limited scalability
- Single point of failure

### EDFS with v2

- Distributed across multiple gateways
- Horizontal scaling with NATS
- Fault tolerance built-in
- Built-in adapters included

::right::

## What we'll build

- Real-time post notifications
- NATS message broker integration
- Multi-instance subscription handling
- Fault-tolerant messaging

### Perfect for

Real-time features at enterprise scale üåê

<!--
- Traditional subscriptions just don't scale well beyond a single instance
- EDFS solves this by using message brokers like NATS or Redis
- The built-in adapters make setup incredibly easy
- This is perfect for real-time features that need to scale to thousands of users
-->

# OpenTelemetry Made Simple

Production-Grade Observability

::left::

### What we'll configure

- Gateway tracing with Jaeger integration
- Erm, that's it... Everything else Just Works ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è

::right::

## What you get

- Perfect traces with proper span hierarchy
- Contextual data in every span
- GraphQL context, HTTP details, upstream execution info

<!--
- The OpenTelemetry setup is incredibly simple now
- Literally one configuration change gets you complete distributed tracing
- Spans are automatically created for all GraphQL operations
- You can see the entire request flow through your federation
-->

---

# Dynamic Logging Revolution

Change Log Levels Without Restarts üîÑ

- Structured logging with request-level metadata
- Request IDs flowing through entire request lifecycle
- Dynamic log level switching during live operation
- Production debugging without downtime

<!--
- Request IDs make debugging so much easier in distributed systems
- And now, logging got even better, you can switch to debug mode without restarting your production gateway!
- This is absolutely essential for troubleshooting production issues
- I'll demo changing log levels live during our session
-->
