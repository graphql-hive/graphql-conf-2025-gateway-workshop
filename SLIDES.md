# Our Demo App

Simple Blog Platform

::left::

### Users Service

- User profiles with ID, name, email
- Role-based access control
- Federation key on user ID

### Posts Service

- HMAC signature security
- Real-time subscriptions

## User Roles

- üëë Admin: Can see all user emails
- ‚úçÔ∏è Editor: Can create/edit posts
- üë§ User: Basic read access

# OpenTelemetry Made Simple

Production-Grade Observability

::left::

### What we'll configure

- Gateway tracing with Jaeger integration
- Automatic span creation for GraphQL operations
- Proper span hierarchy across federation
- Contextual data in every trace

::right::

## What you get

- Perfect traces with proper span hierarchy
- Contextual data in every span
- GraphQL context, HTTP details, upstream execution info
- Automatic custom span parenting

### Result

Complete visibility into your federated system üìà

# Dynamic Logging Revolution

Change Log Levels Without Restarts üîÑ

### We'll demonstrate

- Structured logging with request-level metadata
- Request IDs flowing through entire request lifecycle
- Dynamic log level switching during live operation
- Production debugging without downtime

# Security Flow

Multi-Layer Protection

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Gateway as Hive Gateway
    participant Auth as JWT Validator
    participant Users as Users Service
    participant Posts as Posts Service

    Client->>Gateway: Query with JWT
    Gateway->>Auth: Validate JWT
    Auth-->>Gateway: User + Scopes
    Gateway->>Users: Query user.email (@authenticated)
    Gateway->>Posts: Query posts (@requiresScopes: editor)
    Users-->>Gateway: Email (if authenticated)
    Posts-->>Gateway: Posts (if has editor scope)
    Gateway-->>Client: Combined Response
```

# Multi-Layer Security

JWT + Field-Level Authorization + HMAC

::left::

### Authentication Layer

- JWT token validation
- Support for RS256/HS256 algorithms
- User identity and role extraction

### Authorization Layer

- `@authenticated` directive for basic protection
- `@requiresScopes` directive for role-based access
- Field-level permission control

::right::

## Security Layers

### JWT Authentication

- Validates user identity
- Carries user roles/scopes

### Authorization Directives

- `@authenticated` - requires any valid user
- `@requiresScopes` - requires specific roles

### HMAC Signatures

- Secure subgraph communication
- Protection against tampering

### Introspection

- Available to everyone for development

---
layout: default

# Security Features

Production-Grade Protection

### Rate Limiting üö¶

- Global gateway rate limits
- Per-field rate limiting with `@rateLimit` directive
- Prevent abuse and DoS attacks

### Query Protection üõ°Ô∏è

- Maximum query depth limits
- Query complexity analysis
- Character count restrictions

### Live Demo

We'll try to break our gateway with malicious queries!

# EDFS Architecture

Event-Driven Federated Subscriptions

```mermaid

    Client1[Client 1] --> Gateway1[Gateway Instance 1]
    Client2[Client 2] --> Gateway2[Gateway Instance 2]
    Client3[Client 3] --> Gateway3[Gateway Instance 3]

    Gateway1 --> NATS[NATS Message Broker]
    Gateway2 --> NATS
    Gateway3 --> NATS

    PostService[Post Creation Service] --> NATS

    NATS -.->|Real-time Updates| Gateway1
    NATS -.->|Real-time Updates| Gateway2
    NATS -.->|Real-time Updates| Gateway3

    style Gateway1 fill:orange,color:black

    style Gateway3 fill:orange,color:black
    style NATS fill:green
    style PostService fill:cyan,color:black

# EDFS - Subscriptions That Scale

Event-Driven Federated Subscriptions

::left::

### Traditional Subscriptions

- Tied to single gateway instance
- Limited scalability
- Single point of failure

### EDFS with v2

- Distributed across multiple gateways
- Horizontal scaling with NATS
- Fault tolerance built-in
- Built-in adapters included

::right::

## What we'll build

- Real-time post notifications
- NATS message broker integration
- Multi-instance subscription handling
- Fault-tolerant messaging

### Perfect for

Real-time features at enterprise scale üåê

# Let's Build! üõ†Ô∏è

Follow along or just watch - your choice!

We'll start with an empty directory and build:

1. Two federated GraphQL Yoga subgraphs
2. Production-ready gateway
3. Multi-layer security (JWT + HMAC + field-level auth)
4. Real-time subscriptions with EDFS
5. Full observability stack with Jaeger

Let's unleash the power of federation! üöÄ
