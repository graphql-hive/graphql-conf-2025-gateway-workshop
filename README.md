by [@ardatan](https://github.com/ardatan) and [@enisdenjo](https://github.com/enisdenjo)

This repository is a step-by-step tutorial on how to build a production-ready GraphQL federated system with [Hive Gateway](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/gateway).

> [!TIP]
> You can join whenever you want! See [Just Joining](#just-joining).

## Watch Only or Code Along

The workshop is structured so that you can either just watch, follow along or code together with the presenters.

## Coding Together?

Please make sure you have the prerequisites installed and ready on your device:

- [Bun](https://bun.com/docs/installation)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

And join the presenters in building a production-ready GraphQL federated system!

## Follow Along?

Don't want to code, but want to follow along? No problem, you can simply clone this repository:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:graphql-hive/graphql-conf-2025-gateway-workshop.git
```

and pull the latest changes as the presenter pushes them:

```sh
git pull
```

If you wish, you can also run the system on your device and poke around. Make sure you have dependencies installed:

```sh
bun i
```

And depending on where we are, start subgraphs:

```sh
bun subgraphs
```

And/or start Docker services:

```sh
docker compose up
```

## Just Joining?

You can join in whenever you want! The presenter commits and pushes to this repository as he goes through the workshop, simply clone the repository:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:graphql-hive/graphql-conf-2025-gateway-workshop.git
```

and [start following along](#follow-along)!
